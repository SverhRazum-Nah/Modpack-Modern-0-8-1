There are &emany small details&r that you should learn to help you on your &dquest&r to completing &3TerraFirmaGreg&r.\\n\\n&bBasic Machines&r:\\n- These machines are simple.\\n- They can handle up to &a2A&r.\\n- If you input a &chigher tier&r of energy... &4ðŸ’¥ they explode&r.\\n\\n&dGregtech Multiblocks&r:\\nNow things get interesting.\\nMultiblocks offer more flexibility and power â€” &eif&r you understand how they work."
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"&eStandard Mechanics&r:\\n- If a multiblock can accept &aTWO&r &bEnergy Hatches&r this allows you to use &ahigher-tier recipes&r than the machineâ€™s base tier.\\n\\nExample:\\nIf you're using a &dLarge Mixing Vessel&r and you install &12x IV Energy Hatches&r,\\nit will be able to process &cLuV-tier Mixer recipes&r â€” this is how works the &cElectric Blast Furnace&r.\\n\\nKnowing this will help you get the &6maximum efficiency&r out of your setup and progressing into higher tier materials."
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"&6Some multiblocks only accept one Energy Hatch, but that doesn't mean you're limited to 1A.&r\\n\\nYou can still use a &e4A or 16A Energy Hatch&r. This will allow &bOverclocking&r of recipes but &cnot recipe tier upgrades&r.\\n\\n&dExample&r:\\nThe &aLarge Circuit Assembler&r only accepts &eone Energy Hatch&r. If you install a &c4A IV Energy Hatch&r, you will be able to &eOverclock all IV and lower recipes&r.\\n\\nHowever, you &ccannot craft LuV-tier recipes&r because the machine doesn't support multiple hatches. That limitation is &aintentional&r to prevent skipping the Gregtech progression system.\\n\\n&bSo remember&r: More amps on a single hatch means faster processing, but it wonâ€™t unlock higher-tier recipes unless the multiblock is designed to allow it."

The easiest way to find it is to &ause EMI&r.\\n\\nWith both values, you can do a quick calculation to see if Perfect Overclocking (POC) applies:\\n&bYour machine must be at least 1800K hotter per overclock tier than the recipe requires.&r"
